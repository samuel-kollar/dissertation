The main components of this project are:
1) Developing code to scan the SQL, images and binary records to
   extract the Unknown labelled images
2) Develop a set of descriptors for the detected fish (perhaps via a deep net)
3) Automatically cluster the Unknown fish into groups using the descriptors
4) Develop a manual screening tool that displays fish in a cluster and
   allows a user to mark fish that do not belong to that cluster.
5) Use the tool to screen some or all of the clusters
6) Extract the main clusters from the image data and present to a user.
7) Extend the analysis to also include fish with low recognition scores.
